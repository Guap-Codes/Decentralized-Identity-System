DISCLAIMER: DEVELOPMENT STATUS & SECURITY NOTICE

This Decentralized Identity (DID) System is currently under active development and should be considered experimental software.

Important Considerations:

    Not Production-Ready

        This code has not undergone formal security audits

        Do not use with real assets or sensitive identities in production environments

    Testing Requirements

        Requires rigorous testing on testnets before any deployment

        All smart contracts should be redeployed for mainnet (do not reuse testnet deployments)

    Security Advisory

        Cryptographic implementations need professional review

        Zero-knowledge circuits require specialized auditing

        Key management components are high-risk surfaces

    Limitations

        APIs and storage formats may change without backward compatibility

        No guarantees of correctness, completeness, or fitness for purpose

    Usage Recommendations

        Only deploy to testnets (Sepolia, Goerli, etc.)

        Use with test credentials only - no real personal data

        Maintain separate wallets for development/testing

    No Liability
    The development team accepts no responsibility for:

        Lost funds

        Security breaches

        Identity management failures

        Any other damages arising from use of this software

By using this software, you acknowledge these risks and assume full responsibility for all consequences.

For updates on security status and audit progress, please monitor the official project channels.
